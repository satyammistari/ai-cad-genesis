## 🔧 What is AI-CAD?

**AI-CAD** is an AI-powered 3D CAD platform designed to replace traditional software like SolidWorks or CATIA. It allows engineers to create, edit, simulate, and optimize models using simple text or voice prompts.

> Example:  
> _"Design a gearbox with 3 helical gears (20, 40, 60 teeth), aluminum housing, input shaft 10mm diameter"_  
> → AI instantly generates the parametric 3D model, with full editability.
